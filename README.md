# The Gathering Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "Gatherings" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I used a Model View Controller approach when designing the architecture. 

##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> I received help from classmate. Dylan Commean, and the official TypeScript documentation.


##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> Being honest, this assignment took me more than 20 hours to complete. There is just so many things involved.


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
> 10


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Even though the architecture was mentioned in the notes, Mmaybe give examples of that in actual code and file directories.
